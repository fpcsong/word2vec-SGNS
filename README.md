# word2vec-SGNS
word2vec skip-gram with negative sampling, implemented with pytorch

I know this is totally useless, just for practice.

## usage

```
python3 main.py
```
This will train or load a model, and show some example in tsne.png

## reference 
most code for loading data, showing words in a picture comes from https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/word2vec, and I rewrite the model with pytorch.
